/*
    Any kind of binary function objects can be used with reduce. For instance, and there are many such function objects in the C++ standard <functional> header and the Boost.MPI header <boost/mpi/operations.hpp>. 
    Or, you can create your own function object. Function objects used with reduce must be associative, i.e. f(x, f(y, z)) must be equivalent to f(f(x, y), z). 
    If they are also commutative (i..e, f(x, y) == f(y, x)), Boost.MPI can use a more efficient implementation of reduce. To state that a function object is commutative, you will need to specialize the class is_commutative. 
    For instance, we could modify the previous example by telling Boost.MPI that string concatenation is commutative:

        struct is_commutative<Sum, uint32_t> : mpl::true_ {}; // Here it is safe to mark as commutative and Boost could optimize without risk.

    // boost::mpi::reduce â€” Combine the values stored by each process into a single value at the root (consolidate data into a single root process).
